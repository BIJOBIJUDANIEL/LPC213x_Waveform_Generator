The LPC213x Waveform Generator project demonstrates waveform generation using the LPC213x microcontroller. It includes code to produce sawtooth, triangular, square, and sine waves. The waveform type is selected based on user input.

## Setup

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
   - LPC213x microcontroller.
   - DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) interfaced with the microcontroller.
   - Other required components as per the project specifications.

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - ARM toolchain for LPC213x development.
   - Any necessary IDE or text editor for code development.

3. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/BIJOBIJUDANIEL/LPC213x_Waveform_Generator.git
     ```

## Usage

1. Connect the LPC213x microcontroller to the required hardware components.
2. Build and flash the code to the microcontroller.
3. Run the project and observe the waveform output based on user input.
